# Simple Risk Matrix for Risk Assessment

This is a compact, easy-to-use risk matrix to help assess and prioritize risks. Use Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact.

## Scales

- Likelihood (L)
  - 1 = Rare (unlikely to occur)
  - 2 = Possible (could occur)
  - 3 = Likely (will probably occur)
- Impact (I)
  - 1 = Minor (small disruption, low cost)
  - 2 = Moderate (noticeable impact, moderate cost)
  - 3 = Major (severe disruption, high cost)

Risk Score = L × I (range 1–9)

## Matrix (3×3)

| Impact \ Likelihood | 1 (Rare) | 2 (Possible) | 3 (Likely) |
|---------------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 3 Major             | 3 (Low)  | 6 (High)     | 9 (High)   |
| 2 Moderate          | 2 (Low)  | 4 (Medium)   | 6 (High)   |
| 1 Minor             | 1 (Low)  | 2 (Low)      | 3 (Low)    |

Color guide (visual):
- 1–2: Low (Green)
- 3–4: Medium (Yellow)
- 5–9: High (Red)

## How to use

1. Identify a risk and give it a concise title and description.
2. Assign Likelihood (1–3) and Impact (1–3) based on the definitions above.
3. Calculate Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact.
4. Determine priority by color guide:
   - High (5–9): Immediate attention — define mitigations and owner.
   - Medium (3–4): Plan mitigation and monitor.
   - Low (1–2): Accept or periodically review.
5. After applying controls, re-evaluate Likelihood/Impact and record the Residual Risk Score.

## Quick assessment template (one-line)

- Title: [short risk title]  
- Description: [brief description]  
- Likelihood (1–3): [ ]  
- Impact (1–3): [ ]  
- Initial Score: [L × I]  
- Priority: [Low / Medium / High]  
- Mitigations: [actions]  
- Owner: [person/team]  
- Residual Likelihood: [ ]  
- Residual Impact: [ ]  
- Residual Score: [ ]

## Example

- Title: Data breach from stolen credentials  
- Description: Unauthorized access to user data due to credential compromise.  
- Likelihood: 2 (Possible)  
- Impact: 3 (Major)  
- Initial Score: 6 → High  
- Mitigations: Enforce MFA, rotate credentials, monitor anomalous logins, user education.  
- Owner: Security Team  
- Residual Likelihood: 1 (Rare)  
- Residual Impact: 2 (Moderate)  
- Residual Score: 2 → Low

## Notes and variants
- If you prefer more granularity, switch to a 5×5 matrix (scores 1–25) with similar interpretation (e.g., 1–6 low, 7–14 medium, 15+ high).
- You can store the assessment in a spreadsheet with one row per risk using the template fields above for tracking and reporting.
